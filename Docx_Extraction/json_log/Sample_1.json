    "introduction": [
        "sox4 is a member of the sox (sry-related high-mobility group (hmg) box) family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a transactivation domain (tad) located at the c-terminus. sox4 binds to the minor groove of dna via its hmg box domain, leading to alterations in chromatin architecture and changes in functional and transcriptional activities of downstream genes [1, 2]. ",
        "sox4, like most of sox genes, is expressed with a spatial and temporal pattern and plays pivotal roles in various biological processes at different life stages. in mammals, sox4 expression is limited to embryonic structures and certain adult tissues, such as pancreas, intestine, lymphoid organs and skin [3]. for instance, the expression of sox4 and sox9 in cholangiocytes is required for normal development of bile duct by controlling the expression of notch, mediators of the transforming growth factor-β (tgf-β) and hippo-yap signaling pathways [4]. consistently, adult sox4/sox9loxp/loxp mice show cholestasis, deficient development of peripheral bile ducts, ductular reactions and liver fibrosis [4]. in children, certain sox4 hmg domain missense variants are incapable of transactivating downstream genes and cause neurodevelopmental disease and facial dysmorphism [5]. in addition, sox4 controls early stage of b lymphocyte differentiation by inducing gene rearrangements of immunoglobulin heavy chain through transcriptionally activating the rag1 and rag2 genes, and suppression of wnt signaling by inducing the expression of casein kinase 1ε [6].  a growing list of reports has correlated increased expression of sox4 with tumorigenesis and progression in numerous cancer types, including colorectal [7], breast [8], prostate [9, 10] and gastric [11] cancer. this elevated expression of sox4 promotes different aspects of cancer development and progression by the transcriptional activation of downstream genes in cancer-associated signaling pathways, such as tgf-β/smad [12] and wnt/β-catenin [13], thus endowing malignant cells with apoptosis resistance and promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt) [14].",
        "emt is a fundamental developmental process enabling the acquisition of mesenchymal features by epithelial and cancer cells. these features include the increased expression of the mesenchymal markers fibronectin, n-cadherin and vimentin, which enhances the motility and invasive potential of the cells [14, 15]. therefore, emt is a critical process for cancer development and progression through the regulation of cellular migration, invasion and metastasis. several studies have identified central roles of forkhead box protein c2 (foxc2), twist-related protein 1 (twist1), zinc finger e-box binding homeobox 1 (zeb1), snail family zinc finger 1 (snai1) and snai2 in tumors through the regulation of emt programs [16-19]. moreover, a recent consensus has suggested sox4 as a master regulator of emt in various types of cancer, such as breast, prostate and colorectal cancer (crc) [12, 20, 21]. through orchestrating the emt program, sox4 regulates target genes encoding proteins associated with mesenchymal features, including n-cadherin, tenascin-c (tnc), frizzled-5 (fzd5), adam10, transmembrane protein-2 (tmem2), neuropilin-1, and semaphorin-3a, and thus enhances cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis [22-24]. ",
        "in recent years, a growing body of evidence has highlighted the posttranscriptional regulation of sox4 by a large class of small noncoding rnas (ncrnas; ~20 nt) called micrornas (mirnas). to date, dozens of mirnas have been reported to control cancer development and progression by targeting the 3' untranslated region (3'utr) of sox4 mrna. ectopic expression of sox4-targeting mirnas has been shown to impair the proliferation and motility of crc cells by inhibiting the emt program and thus reinstating the expression of the epithelial markers e-cadherin and zona occludens 1 (zo-1) [25, 26]. furthermore, emerging evidence has identified long noncoding rnas (lncrnas), a class of rnas with lengths greater than 200 nt, as new players in tumorigenesis and tumor progression and as key regulators of sox4 expression. the lncrnas modulate emt programs and apoptosis by acting as competing endogenous rnas (cernas) for sox4-targeting mirnas [27] and by directly targeting the sox4 promoter [28]. in this review, we highlight the role of sox4 in the context of tumorigenesis and malignant transformation. a particular emphasis is placed on the modulation of sox4 expression and function by mirnas and lncrnas and the subsequent modulation of cancer-associated signaling pathways and cancer phenotypes. ",
        "2. sox4-mediated cancer development and progression",
        "meta-analysis of cancer microarray data has classified sox4 as a ‘cancer signature’ gene, suggesting its fundamental role in cancer development [29]. sox4 may promote cancer development and progression via various mechanisms: (i) directly regulating the expression, transcription and/or epigenetic reprogramming of numerous genes implicated in emt, including enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (ezh2), e-cadherin (cdh1), n-cadherin (cdh2), vimentin (vim) and tgfb; (ii) targeting gene networks involved in mirna processing and posttranscriptional regulation; (iii) enhancing proliferative signals in tumors and potentially activating the signal transduction phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (pi3k)/akt pathway through targeting growth factor receptors; (iv) interacting with and activating developmental pathways such as the wnt, notch and hedgehog pathways; and (v) inhibiting differentiation via the repression of transcription factors and induction of homeobox (hox) gene expression. ",
        "2.1. role of sox4 during tumorigenesis",
        "the tumorigenesis-promoting roles of sox4 have been attributed primarily to the inhibition of apoptosis and stimulation of cell survival in various cancer types, the direct coordination of the induction of mesenchymal markers and the indirect regulation and activation of other emt inducers. figure 1 provides a schematic presentation of the role of tgf-β-smad2/3-mediated sox4 activation and the subsequent induction of numerous sox4 target genes involved in cancer cell proliferation, survival, stemness, and emt. accumulating evidence has shown that the downregulation of sox4 induces apoptosis and reduces the survival rate of various types of cancer cells, including prostate cancer [30], lymphoblastic leukemia [31], melanoma [32], triple negative breast cancer [33], lung cancer [34] and osteosarcoma [35, 36]. for example, sox4 inhibition has been reported to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells through the downregulation of the nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) and p65 subunit signaling pathway [32]. moreover, depletion of sox4 by rna interference reduced proliferation potential of lung carcinoma cells, hence suppressing krüppel-like factor 5 (klf5)-mediated tumorigenesis [37]. similarly, sox4 silencing in osteosarcoma reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion and increased apoptosis [38]. these cellular effects were associated with a significant increase in the protein expression of b cell lymphoma 2 (bcl2)-associated x protein (bax), caspase-3 and p53, along with a reduction in the expression of bcl-2, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (mmp2), and mmp9 [38]. consistent with these observations, the inhibition of sox4 in lung cancer cells induced apoptosis via the upregulation of caspase-3 [39]. mechanistically, sox4 depletion modulated the expression of critical genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle control [40, 41]. for instance, in adult prostate epithelium, the deletion of sox4 in the absence of phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten) inhibited tumor progression through the prevention of phosphoinositide-3,4,5-trisphosphate (pip3) accumulation and thus the deactivation of the kinase akt/pkb and its downstream effectors [30].",
        "sox4 is highly expressed in stem cells and early progenitor cells from various tissues. through interaction with and regulation by tgf-β and its downstream signaling molecules smad2/3, sox4 induces the expression of the stem cell marker sox2 [42]. in addition, sox4 mediated the promoting role of tgf-β/smad2/3 in aggressive tumor-initiating cell (tic) phenotypes in glioma [43]. sox4 depletion  suppressed tgf-β-induced emt in gastric cancer cells [11], and delayed the expression of mesenchymal markers in breast cancer cells [12]. in addition, sox4 ablation led to a significant reduction in primary tumor growth in murine breast cancer cells [44]. in lines, mice model with reduced whole-body sox4 expression showed accelerated aging and reduced cancer incidence [3]. in summary, sox4 depletion in a variety of cancer cell models highlights vital roles for sox4 in regulating tumorigenesis. however, the efficacy of sox4 depletion as a therapeutic strategy in clinical trials is not yet tested.",
        "2.2. sox4-directed and -coordinated emt programs",
        "during emt, transcription factors play vital roles in controlling several cellular events such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, adhesion, and migration [11, 14, 45-48]. numerous recent studies have demonstrated important interplay between the transcription factor sox4 and various emt regulators [14]. for instance, sox4 acts as a central component of tgf-β signaling to mediate emt in various types of cancer (reviewed by [14]). the tgf-β signaling pathway is a prime inducer of emt through the transcriptional modulation of transcription factors that suppress epithelial but enhance mesenchymal features [49], and the activation of this signaling pathway mediates the expression of sox4 [14, 20, 50]. in addition, sox4 enhances the transcription of the emt regulators snail, zeb, and twist through intermediate protein or epigenetic modifications, as demonstrated in a murine breast cancer cell model [44], or through the direct induction of these transcription factors, as demonstrated in human gastric cancer cells, leading to enhanced expression of the genes encoding n-cadherin and vimentin and hence promoting emt [11]. sox4 also interacts with the histone methyltransferase ezh2, a component of the polycomb (pcg) repressive complex 2 (prc2). in sox4-deficient cells, ezh2 was shown to complement sox4 during emt and regulate the expression of numerous genes downstream of sox4 [44]; furthermore, in an experimental animal model, sox4 deficiency inhibited breast cancer cells from undergoing emt and metastasizing to the lungs [51]. ",
        "recently, cross-platform analyses of genomic and proteomic data have identified and validated sox4 as a mediator of the pi3k/akt signal transduction pathway [52]. the pi3k/akt pathway is one of the most commonly dysregulated pathways in cancer; this pathway can affect emt programs through several mechanisms to influence tumor aggressiveness [53]. in parallel, sox4 stimulates wnt signaling through the inhibition of β-catenin protein degradation via a casein kinase 2 (ck2)-dependent mechanism [54]. akt can phosphorylate and inhibit the kinase gsk3β, increasing the activity of wnt pathway mediators and β-catenin and thus facilitating the induction of tumor invasion [55, 56]. additionally, sox4 expression was induced in pten-deficient prostate cancer cells through the phosphorylation of akt at serine 473 [30]. moreover, a significant reduction in activated β-catenin was observed in prostate tissue from pten/sox4 conditional double-knockout mice [30]. concordantly, sox4 targets growth factor receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1 (fgfrl1), and insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (igf2r) to enhance tumor cell proliferation through the activation of the pi3k/akt pathway [57]. in summary, sox4 seems to be critical modulator of various signaling pathways and possibly for crosstalk between pathways and to be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, cell cycle arrest, emt and cancer. ",
        "2.3. sox4 as a mediator of tumor migration and invasion",
        "sox4 exerts its promotive effects on primary tumor growth and cell metastasis via the direct regulation of genes encoding key components of developmental and growth factor signaling pathways, including tnc, integrin alpha-v (itgav), rac family small gtpase 1 (rac1), paxillin (pxn), egfr, fzd5, heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), patched-1 (ptch1), delta-like 1 (dll1), lysine methyltransferase 2a (kmt2a), forkhead box a1 (foxa1), zinc finger protein 281 (znf281), as well as nk3 homeobox 1 (nkx3.1) [57, 58], as summarized in figure 1. in addition, sox4 augments metastasis and invasion through the inhibition of terminal differentiation via the repression of nkx3.1 and activation of mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (mll1), which subsequently activate hox gene expression, leading to emt [58, 59]. sox4 and sox9 are the only two sox family members linked to tgf-β and emt; sox4 deficiency was sufficient to prevent tgf-β-mediated emt in normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells (mecs), and thus inhibited mammary tumor growth and metastasis [44]. upregulated expression of sox4 promotes the migration and invasion of melanoma cells [60]. these promotive effects are attributed to the activation of the nf-κb/p65 signaling pathway [32] and mmp9 and mmp2, members of the metalloprotease family responsible for the breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ecm) microstructure, a hallmark of tumor invasion and metastasis [61]. moreover, ectopic expression of sox4 was sufficient to increase the expression of tmem2, a transmembrane protein that mediates metastatic migration and invasion of breast cancer cells [24]. ",
        "3.0 epigenetic regulation of sox4 ",
        "various genetic mechanisms such as dna amplification, deletion, or mutation; or epigenetic mechanisms (i.e. dna and histone modification) can lead to alter sox4 expression. interestingly and despite its documented overexpression in various human malignancies, sox4 promoter hypomethylation or gene amplification is only observed in a few cancer types [31, 62]. this has suggested the existence of other regulatory mechanism, such as mirna and lncrna-dependent mechanisms, leading to its upregulated expression in human cancers. ",
        "3.1 mirna biogenesis and function in cancer",
        "mirnas are a class of small and highly conserved noncoding rnas that orchestrate the posttranscriptional regulation of protein expression; hence, they are implicated in regulating numerous biological processes under normal and pathological conditions. mirna genes are encoded in various regions of the genome; approximately 40% of mirnas are found embedded within introns of protein-coding genes, while approximately 10% are located within introns of long ncrna transcripts [63]. with some exceptions, a general downregulation of mirnas is observed in cancers, mostly due to chromosomal anomalies, epigenetic alterations or altered functioning of the mirna biogenesis machinery [64]. interestingly, more than half of all mirna genes are located at fragile sites, in cancer-associated genomic regions, and in minimal regions of amplification or loss of heterozygosity, hence are more prone to altered expression [65]. ",
        "mirnas have emerged as dominant regulators of gene expression in different human cancers [66, 67]. during tumorigenesis, mirnas can function as oncogenes (oncomirs) or as tumor suppressors, depending on the type of malignancy and the specific mirna [68]. although the vast majority of studies have focused on studying individual mirna targets, most mirnas orchestrate their effects by targeting multiple mrna transcripts, some of which may reside in the same or in other related pathways [69, 70]. for example, let-7 is the first identified tumor suppressor mammalian mirna that is normally expressed in epithelial tissues and is frequently downregulated during transformation [71]; let-7 targets many mrna transcripts such as those of ras [72] and lin28, an inhibitor of mirna processing, and itself is a target of negative feedback regulation by lin28 [73]. mir-21 is an oncomir that is overexpressed in the majority of human cancers and inhibits several tumor suppressor genes, thus promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion and tumor metastasis [74, 75]. ",
        "3.2 mirna-mediated sox4 regulation in human cancers ",
        "accumulated evidence revealed a close relationship between mirna and sox4 expression in cancers of epithelial and non-epithelial origin. many mirnas have been found to target sox4 through direct binding to the sox4 3'utr, thus regulating a plethora of vital processes in cancer cells, such as proliferation, migration, invasion, emt, and tumor progression. this finding is not surprising given that sox4 has a relatively large 3`utr (4241 nt; targetscan human). sox4 targeting by mirnas slows emt in various ways, including (i) preventing the sox4/ezh2 axis from inducing the epigenetic modification of major emt molecules; (ii) inhibiting the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which further suppresses cell proliferation and migration and promotes apoptosis; (iii) suppressing tgf-β-induced emt; and (iv) decreasing the levels of p-pi3k, p-akt, p-smad2 and p-smad3. sox4 interacts directly with β-catenin [76], and the deletion or mirna-mediated inhibition of sox4 reduces the level of active β-catenin in vivo; this reduction led to a significant reduction in akt phosphorylation in cancer cells in vitro [30, 52]. in this section, we will summarize the current state of knowledge about the regulation of sox4 by mirnas in various human malignancies. the sox4-mirna-lncrna network in different human cancers is presented in figure 2.",
        "the sox4-targeting mirnas frequently altered in human cancers are summarized in table 1. in breast cancer, mir-335 was found to suppress metastasis and invasion through targeting the transcription factor sox4 and the extracellular matrix component tnc [77]. furthermore, in a cohort of 368 breast cancer patients, those with primary breast tumors that were positive for the mir-335 signature showed unfavorable metastasis-free survival [77]. mir-93, a member of the mir-106b-25 cluster, was found to induce mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (met) and to moderate the proliferation and differentiation state of breast cancer stem cells (bcscs) through targeting sox4 and several additional genes, such as high-mobility group at-hook 2 (hmga2), akt3, ezh1, janus kinase 1 (jak1), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) [78]. mir-338-3p is downregulated in breast cancer tissues; this downregulation was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis and tumor-node-metastasis (tnm) stage [79]. mir-191-5p was identified as an oncomir in different human malignancies [80-82]. interestingly, mir-191-5p was shown to be a target for p53 suppression, and itself can indirectly target p53 expression through inhibition of sox4 [83].  hence, anti-mir-191-5p promoted breast cancer apoptosis in response to doxorubicin, through sox4 and p53 induction [83]. therefore, the p53-mir-191-5p-sox4 axis has a major impact on apoptosis and drug resistance in breast cancer. mir-320 is also frequently downregulated in breast cancer, correlating with elevated sox4 expression [84].",
        "our group first identified sox4 as a target of the mir-212/132 cluster in breast cancer cell lines [85]. we found that the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd) transcriptionally activates the sox4-targeting mir-212/132 cluster, thus suppressing cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis [85]. similarly, the activation of ahr by flavipin suppressed the migration and invasion of breast cancer cell lines by inducing the mir-212/132- sox4 axis [86]. moreover, the activation of ahr by tcdd or 6-methyl-1,3,8-trichlorodibenzofuran (mcdf) induced the expression of the sox4-targeting mir-335 and inhibited lung metastasis [87]. these observations suggest ligand-activated ahr as a potential strategy to downregulate sox4 via mirnas.     ",
        "numerous studies in crc have identified several sox4-mirna circuits. our group first identified the downregulation of the mir-320 family in crc [88]. we subsequently identified sox4, forkhead box m1 (foxm1), and foxq1 as bona fide targets of mir-320c, that promote cell migration and chemotherapy resistance in crc cells lacking mir-320c [69]. moreover, in crc, mir-187 downregulation was linked to tumor metastasis and poor prognosis, which was found to target sox4 [26]. mir-363-3p and mir-539 were also found to target sox4 in crc [25, 89]. reduced expression of mir-539 correlated with lymph node metastasis and tnm stage in crc patients, and mir-539 expression was found to attenuate cell proliferation and invasion in vitro via sox4 suppression [89]. ",
        "in addition, many sox4-mir circuits have been identified in several other human cancers. for instance, mir-129-5p downregulation was found to be associated with poor prognosis in bladder cancer and to promote cell death via targeting sox4 [90]. similarly, zhang and colleagues demonstrated a tumor suppressor role for mir-129-5p in chondrosarcoma [91]. mir-129-2 was found to be epigenetically silenced in endometrial, gastric, esophageal, and hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to increases in sox4 expression and cell proliferation [92-95]. in ovarian cancer, mir-138 and the mir-212/132 cluster were shown to function as tumor suppressors through targeting sox4 [96, 97]. in addition, sox4 was found to be targeted by the mir-212/132 cluster and mir‑25‑3p in osteosarcoma [35, 36, 98, 99] and by mir-30a and the mir-212/132 cluster in prostate cancer [100, 101]. in vcap prostate cancer cells, metformin upregulated mir-30a, which in turn repressed sox4 expression and subsequently inhibited tgf-β-induced emt, as manifested by inhibiting the increase in n-cadherin and vimentin, and the reduction in e-cadherin and β-catenin [100]. similarly, mir-19a-3p overexpression decreased the levels of sox4 mrna and protein, subsequently suppressing the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells [10]. in esophageal cancer, mir-31 and mir-133a were found to target sox4, hence suppressing tumorigenesis [102, 103]. in gastric cancer, mir-211 downregulation led to enhanced sox4 expression and tumor cell growth and invasion [104]. additionally, mir-338-3p was shown to suppress lung cancer via targeting sox4 [34].",
        " in hematological malignancies, mir-204 was found to be underexpressed and to target sox4 in t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [105]. interestingly, the mir-212/132 cluster was found to regulate b cell development. in particular, mir-132 was found to target sox4; hence, the re-expression of mir-132 inhibited b cell cancer development in a c-myc expression model [106].  ",
        "while the literature presented thus far has highlighted a role for several mirnas in regulating sox4 expression in various human malignancies, sox4 has also been found to control the transcription of dicer in cutaneous melanoma cells through binding to its promoter and increasing its activity, leading to the expression of a substantial number of cancer-associated mirnas [68, 107]. concordantly, a previous study showed that sox4 can directly regulate the mirna processing machinery in prostate cancer cells through targeting argonaute 1, dicer, and rna helicase a [57]. the prc2 is responsible for the methylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (h3k27) [108]. prc2 can mediate mono-, di- and trimethylation of h3k27; the later is associated with heterochromatin formation and the repression of key transcriptional factors [109]. the catalytic subunit of prc2 is the set domain-containing protein ezh2 (or ezh1) can be functional only in the context of the full prc core complex [109]. the sox4/ezh2 complex repressed the expression of the mir-212/132 cluster through direct recruitment to the promoter regions of members of this cluster and the deposition of h3k27me3 epigenetic repressive marks (fig. 1) [97]. sox4/ezh2 axis-mediated h3k27me3 epigenetic silencing highlighted the reciprocal crosstalk between mir-129-5p and sox4 expression in breast cancer [110]. similarly, the corepressor complex composed of sox4, ezh2 and histone deacetylase 3 (hdac3) enhanced the proliferation and invasion of esophageal tumor cells through epigenetic silencing of mir-31 by h3k27me3 [102]. taken together, these findings indicate that sox4-mediated ezh2 expression induces the epigenetic modification of major emt molecules to promote emt and metastasis. therefore, there appears to be a reciprocal relationship between sox4 and the mirna biogenesis and silencing pathway. ",
        "interestingly, bu and colleagues reported a positive feedback loop in crc, in which tgf-β induced mir-1269a expression through sox4 activation and mir-1269a in turn enhanced tgf-β signaling through targeting smad7 and hoxd10 [21]. tgf-β treatment significantly enhanced the expression of sox4, while sox4 silencing (as with mirna targeting) reversed the tgf-β-induced invasion and sphere formation abilities of gastric cancer cells [11]. moreover, sox4 overexpression promoted the emt phenotype in vcap prostate cancer cells [111], while the treatment of prostate cancer cells with tgf-β led to epigenetic modifications in the ets-related gene (erg) and sox4 promotors that were associated with the direct binding of erg to the sox4 promotor [20]. silencing both genes restored the epithelial characteristics and reduced the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells [20].",
        "it is apparent that sox4 is subjected to complex mirna-mediated regulatory mechanisms. notably, few mirnas play crucial role in regulating sox4 expression across multiple cancer types such as mir-204, mir-132 and/or mir-212 and mir-129-3p. in addition, mir-320 plays an important role in targeting not only sox4, but also foxm1 and foxq1, in colorectal and breast cancer. collectively, these results suggest broad roles for these mirnas in regulating sox4-mediated tumorigenesis.       ",
        "3.3 lncrna-dependent sox4 regulation",
        " lncrnas interact with rna-binding proteins during chromatin remodeling, hence modulating various dynamic and epigenetic processes. these ncrnas act at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional and translational levels [112] and also may modulate their function by acting as cernas for mrna-targeting mirnas (fig. 2) [113]. jiao and colleagues reported that lncrna-uca1 promoted esophageal cancer cell proliferation through functioning as a cerna for mir-204, hence inhibiting the interaction between mir-204 and the sox4 3'utr and leading to elevated sox4 expression [114]. similarly, androgen receptor negatively induced lncrna (arnila) acted as a cerna for mir-204 to upregulate sox4 expression, induce emt and promote invasion and metastasis in triple negative breast cancer cells [115]. moreover, elevated expression of arnila was found to correlate with poor progression-free survival in triple negative breast cancer patients. in hepatocellular carcinoma, stat3 signaling was found to induce the expression of lncrna hoxd-as1, which in turn sequestered mir-130a-3p, thus inhibiting mir-130a-3p-mediated sox4 repression and leading to enhanced hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis [116]. in addition, lncrna-pagbc was also reported to activate the akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) pathway and to promote gallbladder tumor metastasis through the downregulation of mir-133b and mir-511, leading to the elevated expression of sox4 and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3 (pik3r3), respectively [117]. similarly, colon cancer-associated transcript-1 (ccat1) promoted cisplatin resistance in lung cancer cells through the downregulation of mir-130a-3p and the subsequent induction of sox4 expression [118]. in a recent study, lncsox4 was found to initiate the expression of sox4 through directly interacting with and recruiting stat3 to the sox4 promoter, promoting the self-renewal of liver tics [28]. mir-381 is known to target sox4 in gastric cancer [119]. interestingly, zhang and colleagues reported that lncrna taurine-upregulated gene 1 (tug1) sequestered endogenous mir-381, promoting the metastasis of gastric cancer cells via sox4 upregulation [119]. in runx1-rearranged acute leukemia, lncrna casc15 enhanced sox4 expression through the recruitment of yin and yang-1 (yy1) to the sox4 promoter [120]. in lung adenocarcinoma, lncrna cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (casc2) inhibited emt through sox4 downregulation, although the exact mechanism by which casc2 downregulated sox4 expression was not revealed [121]. lncbrm promoted ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion through the suppression of mir-204 and the subsequent upregulation of sox4 expression [122]. lncrna abhd11-as1 was shown to promote crc development through acting as a cerna for mir-133a and hence promoting sox4 expression [123]. ",
        "notably, while mir-204 plays a crucial role in regulating sox4 expression in leukemia, breast, ovarian, and gastric cancer, mir-204 itself is subjected to additional layer of negative regulation by arnila and uca1. this complex regulatory network highlights an important role for the fine-tuning of sox4 expression to prevent tumorigenesis in multiple cancer types.",
        "4. sox4 as a potential prognostic biomarker in human cancers",
        "\tsince the initial discovery of sox4, several studies have identified sox4 as a potential prognostic biomarker in most human cancers, correlating its higher expression in tumor tissues with malignancy and poor prognosis in cancer patients [7, 8, 124, 125]. increased expression of sox4 in different types of human cancers is often associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. based on a meta-analysis including more than 1300 cancer patients, high expression of sox4 correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting that sox4 is a pan-cancer prognostic biomarker [124]. computational analysis revealed a significant correlation between elevated sox4 expression and poor metastasis-free survival in a cohort of 200 early-stage lymph node-negative breast cancer patients [44]. in prostate cancer, elevated sox4 expression was associated with a poor clinical outcome [111]. in a multivariate analysis conducted in 148 breast cancer patients, elevated sox4 expression was significantly associated with poor clinical outcome, regardless of tumor stage, tumor size, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis [8]. moreover, in a cohort of 168 gastric cancer patients, elevated nuclear sox4 expression correlated with a number of clinical parameters, including stage, invasion depth, vascular invasion status, nodal status, distant metastasis, and poor disease-free survival [126]. analysis of the microarray expression profiles of 424 crc samples and subsequent validation in two independent cohorts of stage ii crc patients revealed that high sox4 expression was correlated with an increased risk of recurrence (hr 2.7, p=0.01) [127]. immunohistochemical examination of sox4 expression in tumor tissues from 263 patients with colon cancer revealed nuclear sox4 overexpression correlated with tumor stage, depth of invasion, and distant metastasis [128]. in a multivariate analysis, increased sox4 expression was suggested as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients [129]. taken together, these data warrant further investigation, and a side-by-side comparison with existing biomarkers, for potential development of sox4-based molecular signatures for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

        "cancer development and progression are mediated by alterations in transcriptional and posttranscriptional networks, leading to a disturbed balance in the activity of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. in this context, sox4 promotes different aspects of cancer development and progression through the transcriptional activation and epigenetic modification of downstream genes and, thus endowing malignant cells with a proliferation and survival advantage and with emt and invasion capabilities. a large body of data also correlates elevated sox4 expression with advanced stages of malignancy and poorer clinical outcomes, suggesting a potential opportunity for combating cancer by targeting sox4. indeed, numerous preclinical studies have suggested the efficacy of targeted sox4 depletion as a therapeutic opportunity in various human cancer models.  ",
        "increasing number of studies have identified numerous sox4-targeting mirnas and highlighted the consequences of altered mirna expression on the modulation and/or inhibition of cancer progression. in fact, we observed more than 25 mirnas to target sox4 in various human malignancies, which is not frequently seen in various biological systems. one plausible explanation is that sox4 has relatively large 3`utr region spanning more than 4000 nt, thus allowing the binding of dozens of mirnas. sox4 also induces the expression of a number of genes involved in mirna biogenesis and maturation (i.e. dicer), thus causing global changes in mirna expression in cancer cells. on the other hand, sox4 represses the expression of several mirnas through ezh2-mediated h3k27me3 epigenetic modification. a number of lncrnas also play a role in this complex regulatory network (summarized in figure 1 and figure 2). lncrnas enhance sox4 expression, or they can act as cernas to sequester sox4-targeting mirnas. this complex regulatory network highlights a pivotal role for sox4 and the level of regulation required to keep this master regulator fine-tuned to prevent tumorigenesis. ",
        "abundant preclinical data have shown the feasibility of utilizing mirna-based therapies in vivo in various disease models [130-132]. notably, miravirsen, a mir-122 inhibitor previously shown to reduce the hepatitis c viral load in a primate hepatitis c virus infection model, has entered clinical trials [131]. in the context of cancer therapeutics, mrx34, a mir34 mimic, is the first to enter multicenter phase i clinical trial to treat 47 patients with advanced stage iv cancers (multiple cancer types) [133]. the results from the trial showed that mrx34 treatment, with dexamethasone premedication, exerts antitumor activity in a subset of patients with refractory advanced solid tumors [133]. however this study was subsequently terminated due to immune-related adverse effects [134]. zandwijk and colleagues explored the efficacy of mir-16-based mirna mimic, packaged in an engeneic dream vector (edv), targeting egfr-expressing mesothelioma cells via bispecific antibodies in patients with advanced pleural mesothelioma [135]. the authors reported that only a patient out of 22 patients achieved an objective response [135]. therefore, the translation of the in vitro and preclinical findings into clinical trials is just beginning. additionally, the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting sox4 as more efficient therapeutic strategies and the translation of preclinical data into the clinic are needed.  ",
        " despite the wealth of information on the role of sox4 during tumorigenesis and epigenetic regulation, a number of outstanding questions pertaining to its epigenetic regulation and its therapeutic potential remains to be addressed. for instance, what is the biological relevance of the identified mirnas and lncrnas in regulating sox4 expression and tumorigenesis under physiological conditions? employing a conditional and tissue-specific gain and loss of function approaches in various cancer animal models could provide some insight on the contribution of ncrnas-sox4 circuits during tumorigenesis in vivo. is it plausible to target sox4 as a therapeutic strategy in cancer patients? developing clinical-grade small molecule and tumor tissue-directed inhibitors for sox4 could hold the key to answering these questions.
